# Every E24 Resistor

Here are the step files for every E24 resistor from 1 ohm to 10M ohm, sorted by
tolerance.

All of these files were created using the E24 Resistor Generator, available at
[github.com/HBoyd255/e24-resistor-generator](https://github.com/HBoyd255/e24-resistor-generator).

All these files are under the MIT license, so feel free to use them in your
